Alien Bit
========================
Earth-Alien Transmissions Services (EATS) have intercepted some transmissions from a nearby star. It appears that aliens
are trying to communicate with us, but the transmissions are just long strings of numbers with a decimal place at the
beginning. You, a genius cryptographer and linguist, managed to figure out what these numbers mean. It looks like the
aliens just have a different way of computing! Rather than having just two states like we do (1 and 0), the alien
computers measure the intensity of a single particle with an accuracy that allows reading nearly unlimited states between
0 and 1. This means that a long string's worth of data can be stored in one alien "bit'. Conveniently, the aliens also
use ASCII - what luck! Now all you need to do is write a program that turns an alien bit abit into a translated string.


Example
------------
* __For__ `abit = "0.116101115116035049"`, the output should be
`alienBit(abit) = "test#1"`.

    The alien bit can be split into 6 ASCII symbols:

    `116 -> 't'`
    
    `101 -> 'e'`
    
    `115 -> 's'`
    
    `116 -> 't'`
    
    `35 -> '#'`
    
    `49 -> '1'`
    
    Thus, this alien transmission contains the message "test#1".

Input/Output
--------------

* __[time limit]__ 4000ms (py)
* __[input]__ string abit 

    A string that represents a number between 0 and 1, with the number of decimal places divisible by 3.

    Guaranteed constraints:
    
    `5 ≤ abit.length ≤ 1001.`

* __[output]__ string

    A translated string of ASCII characters.
