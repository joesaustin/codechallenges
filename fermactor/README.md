Fermat's factorization method is:
==================================
If `a · b = n`  (where `a ≤ b`), then there exist some `c` and `d` such that `n = c2 - d2`.
Your goal is to return for given n such c and d as an array.
Since we want c and d to be uniquely determined, in all test cases n is a semiprime number.

Example
--------------------------------

* For `n = 15`, the output should be
`fermactor(n) = [4, 1]`.
`15 = 42 - 12`.

Input/Output
-------------

*__[time limit] 4000ms (py)__

*__[input] integer n__

A semiprime number.

Guaranteed constraints:
`10 < n < 10**9`.

[output] array.integer

`c` and `d` are guaranteed to be integers if the difference between `a` and `b` is even. For all test cases, this is true.
